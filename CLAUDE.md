# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a reference library containing scanned pages from "The 5/3/1 Program" by Jim Wendler - a popular strength training methodology. This is NOT a software development project; it contains educational content about weightlifting and strength training.

## Repository Structure

The Book/ directory contains 33 numbered chapters (01-33), each covering a specific aspect of the 5/3/1 training program:

**Core Program Foundation (01-06):**
- 01_Philosophy: Core principles of the 5/3/1 methodology
- 02_Program: Basic program structure (4-week cycles with 5/3/1 rep schemes)
- 03-06: Individual lift techniques (Squat, Press, Bench, Deadlift)

**Program Execution (07-15):**
- Training guidelines: gear, beginning recommendations, last set protocols
- Progress tracking: advancement, micro-increments, dealing with plateaus
- Warm-up protocols and rep max calculations
- Managing suboptimal training sessions

**Supplementary Work (16-18):**
- 16_Assistance_Exercises: Largest chapter with supplementary exercises (10 pages)
- 17_Abs: Core training
- 18_Great_Debate: Additional considerations

**Program Variations (19-30):**
- Multiple template variations: Boring But Big, Triumvirate, Periodization Bible, etc.
- Different training frequencies: 2-day, 3-day, and full-body splits
- Specialized adaptations: CrossFit integration, bodyweight variations

**Practical Application (31-33):**
- 31_Beginners: Starting guidelines
- 32_Eating: Nutrition recommendations
- 33_FAQ: Frequently asked questions

## File Organization

Each chapter directory contains sequentially numbered PNG files (001.png, 002.png, etc.):
- Single-page chapters: Most chapters contain 1-2 scanned pages
- Multi-page chapters: 16_Assistance_Exercises has 10 pages
- Some chapters are placeholder directories with minimal content

## The 5/3/1 Program Basics

Understanding the core methodology helps with navigating and organizing content:

**Training Structure:**
- 4 main lifts: Standing Military Press, Deadlift, Bench Press, Squat
- 4-week training cycles with progressive rep schemes
- Week 1: 3×5 sets, Week 2: 3×3 sets, Week 3: 5/3/1 sets, Week 4: deload
- Flexible scheduling: 2-4 training days per week

**Philosophy:**
- Emphasis on big, multi-joint compound movements
- Start too light to allow sustainable long-term progress
- Progress slowly and consistently
- Simple, proven approach without unnecessary complexity

## Working with This Repository

**Viewing Content:**
- All content is in PNG image format (scanned book pages)
- Use image viewing tools or the Read tool to examine pages
- Pages are numbered sequentially within each chapter

**Organizational Tasks:**
- If reorganizing, maintain the numbered chapter structure (01-33)
- Keep sequential page numbering (001.png, 002.png, etc.)
- Preserve the pedagogical flow from foundational concepts to advanced variations

**No Build or Test Commands:**
- This repository contains no code to compile, build, or test
- No package managers, dependencies, or development tools required
- Pure content reference library
